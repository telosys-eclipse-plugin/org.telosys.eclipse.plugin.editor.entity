An Entity document can contains N types of partitions :
 - COMMENT    : // comment
 - LITERAL    : "string literal"
 - FIELD BODY : multiline part form ":" to ";" 
 - default    : all other parts 

Partitions are managed in EntityDocumentProvider by :
  FastPartitioner (Eclipse) using EntityPartitionScanner (project) 
    EntityPartitionScanner uses : 
     (REMOVED) - EndOfLineRule ("//",        commentToken ) 
     (REMOVED) - SingleLineRule("\"", "\"",  literalToken, '\\' )
     - MultiLineRule (":",  ";",   bodyToken )
   
NB: In Eclipse plugin development using the FastPartitioner for a text editor, nested partitions are not directly supported. 
The FastPartitioner assumes a flat partitioning model, meaning partitions cannot overlap or nest within each other.

//comment and "literal" between ":" and ";" are not partitions, they are part of BODY partition
